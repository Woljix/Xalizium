# Xalizium Engine Alpha (Not Really Playable)


This is a small "game-engine" that i have been working on, it's not the best, but i use it to experiment on. I have learned alot from making this. 

The engine is not intended for any commerical or open-source usage. It is merely a personal project/experiment.

But if you can get any usage out of it, feel free to use it for anything you want!
